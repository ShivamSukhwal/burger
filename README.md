Eat the burger is an app where you can choose a burger from a drop down list
From here it is inserted into another list that asks you if you'd like to pay for that burger by hitting on the \$ icon.
Once you have done that it will transport the burger into a third and final list asking you if you want to eat the burger.
Once you have hit the red icon it will disappear from the list and your belly will be full.
